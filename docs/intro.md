# Introduction

Fast Shell supports the management of custom scripts, which can quickly execute shell commands. The supported commands depend on the shell environment used by the current IDE.
Fast Shell has a fairly high degree of freedom. All instructions are completely defined by the user.

Replace `a very long command` with a short `command`. And it's integrated into the IDE's `Run Anything`, so you can easily open it with `Double Ctrl`.

The goal of Fast Shell is to let you get rid of **alias** in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

It doesn't matter if you have defined some commonly used directives in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`. You can still add it to FastShell to execute.
